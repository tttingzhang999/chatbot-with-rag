# TERRAFORM BACKEND CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
# Copy this file to backend.tfvars and fill in your values
# NEVER commit backend.tfvars to git - it contains sensitive information
#
# IMPORTANT: Backend configuration cannot use variables!
# You must provide these values during terraform init:
#   terraform init -backend-config=backend.tfvars
#=============================================================================

# S3 bucket name for storing Terraform state
# Prerequisites: Create this S3 bucket before running terraform init
# Recommended: Enable versioning and encryption on this bucket
bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"

# Path to the state file within the bucket
# Use a meaningful path like: "username/project-name.tfstate" or "team/project-name.tfstate"
key = "username/hr-chatbot.tfstate"

# AWS region where the S3 bucket is located
region = "us-east-1"

# AWS CLI profile name for accessing the backend bucket
# This should match your aws_profile variable in terraform.tfvars
profile = "default"

# AWS Account ID(s) that are allowed to access this backend
# This should match your aws_account_id variable in terraform.tfvars
allowed_account_ids = ["123456789012"]
